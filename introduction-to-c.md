# Introduction to C++

## What is C++?

C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Labs. C++ is known for its efficiency, flexibility, and power, making it widely used in various domains such as system/software development, game development, embedded systems, and more.

One of the key features of C++ is its support for object-oriented programming (OOP), which allows developers to organize code into reusable objects that can contain both data and methods to manipulate that data. Additionally, C++ supports features like templates, which enable generic programming, and it provides low-level memory manipulation through pointers.

C++ has a rich standard library that includes a wide range of functions and classes for tasks such as input/output operations, string manipulation, algorithms, and data structures. It's a highly versatile language that can be used to create anything from small utilities to large-scale applications and systems.
