# Introduction to C++

## What is C++?

C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Labs. C++ is known for its efficiency, flexibility, and power, making it widely used in various domains such as system/software development, game development, embedded systems, and more.

One of the key features of C++ is its support for object-oriented programming (OOP), which allows developers to organize code into reusable objects that can contain both data and methods to manipulate that data. Additionally, C++ supports features like templates, which enable generic programming, and it provides low-level memory manipulation through pointers.

C++ has a rich standard library that includes a wide range of functions and classes for tasks such as input/output operations, string manipulation, algorithms, and data structures. It's a highly versatile language that can be used to create anything from small utilities to large-scale applications and systems.

## History and background


The history of C++ dates back to the late 1970s when Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began working at Bell Labs (AT&T). At that time, he was involved in a project that required simulation for analyzing the Unix kernel. While working on this project, Stroustrup realized that the available programming languages, particularly C, lacked features necessary for the task at hand.

In 1979, Stroustrup started developing what he initially called "C with Classes." This language was an extension of the C programming language, adding support for classes, inheritance, and other object-oriented programming (OOP) features. Stroustrup's goal was to create a language that combined the efficiency and flexibility of C with the benefits of OOP.

By 1983, the language had evolved significantly, and Stroustrup renamed it to C++. The "++" symbol represents the increment operator in C, indicating that C++ is an improvement over C. The first edition of "The C++ Programming Language," often referred to as "The C++ Bible," was published in 1985, providing comprehensive documentation and insights into the language.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, C++ gained popularity, especially in industries where performance and efficiency were critical, such as system programming, game development, and embedded systems. The language continued to evolve, with new features and improvements being added over time.

In 1998, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the first official standard for the C++ programming language, known as C++98. This standardization helped ensure the portability and compatibility of C++ code across different platforms and compilers.

Since then, several new versions of the C++ standard have been released, including C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20, each introducing new features, enhancements, and refinements to the language.

Today, C++ remains a widely used and influential programming language, powering a vast array of applications, systems, and technologies. Its rich history and ongoing development make it a cornerstone of modern software engineering.
